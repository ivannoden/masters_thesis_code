The code uses Sage in a Jupyter notebook.

The file Cr_bundle_calculations.ipynb calculates the Bruhat decompsotions for the flags in a roof of type $C_{3r-1}$ and then describes all the vector bundles in the Koszul complex associated to the zero locus of a section.

The file bruhat_decomposition_calculator.ipynb can calculate the Bruhat decomposition of any maximal flag variety and will compare two provided (in fact, it is very easy to adapt the code to calculate the decomposition for any flag variety). This is much slower than the method specific to the $ C_r $ case used in the other file.
